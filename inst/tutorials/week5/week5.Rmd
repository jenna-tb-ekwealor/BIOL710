## Getting Started

In this lab, you'll investigate the probability distribution that is most central
to statistics: the normal distribution.  If you are confident that your data are 
nearly normal, that opens the door to many powerful statistical methods.  Here 
we'll use the graphical tools of R to assess the normality of our data and also 
learn how to generate random numbers from a normal distribution.

### Load packages

In this lab, we will explore and visualize the data using the **tidyverse** suite of packages as well as the **openintro** package.

Let's load the packages.

```{r load-packages, exercise = T}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
```


### The data

This week you'll be working with pollen nutritional data.  This data set contains pollen data from
421 genera from different plant families.
Let's take a quick peek at the first few rows of the data.

Either you can use `glimpse` like before, or `head` to do this.

```{r load-data, exercise = T}
glimpse(pollen)
head(pollen)
```

You'll see that for every plant taxon there are 2 nutritional measurements: calories and
grams of protein.

Let's first focus on just mint and daisy taxa.

```{r male-female, exercise = T}
mints <- pollen %>%
  filter(plant_group == "mints")
daisies <- pollen %>%
  filter(plant_group == "daisies")
```

Make plots to visualize the distributions of the grams of protein from these two plant groups. How do their centers, shapes,
and spreads compare?

```{r dghqyduwvsgyzshm, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(mints, aes(x = ___)) + ___
ggplot(daisies, aes(x = ___)) + ___
```

```{r dghqyduwvsgyzshm-solution}
ggplot(mints, aes(x = protein)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(daisies, aes(x = protein)) + geom_histogram()
```

```{r dghqyduwvsgyzshm-check}
# check code
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

## The normal distribution

In your description of the distributions, did you use words like *bell-shaped* 
or *normal*?  It's tempting to say so when faced with a unimodal symmetric 
distribution.

To see how accurate that description is, you can plot a normal distribution curve 
on top of a histogram to see how closely the data follow a normal distribution. 
This normal curve should have the same mean and standard deviation as the data. 
You'll be focusing on grams of protein from daisies, so let's store
them as a separate object and then calculate some statistics that will be referenced 
later. 

```{r female-hgt-mean-sd, exercise = T}
daisymean <- mean(daisies$protein)
daisysd   <- sd(daisies$protein)
```

Next, you make a density histogram to use as the backdrop and use the `lines` 
function to overlay a normal probability curve. The difference between a 
frequency histogram and a density histogram is that while in a frequency 
histogram the *heights* of the bars add up to the total number of observations, 
in a density histogram the *areas* of the bars add up to 1. The area of each bar
can be calculated as simply the height *times* the width of the bar. Using a 
density histogram allows us to properly overlay a normal distribution curve over
the histogram since the curve is a normal probability density function that also
has area under the curve of 1. Frequency and density histograms both display the
same exact shape; they only differ in their y-axis. You can verify this by
comparing the frequency histogram you likely constructed earlier and the density
histogram created by the commands below.

```{r hist-height, exercise = T}
ggplot(data = daisies, aes(x = protein)) +
        geom_blank() +
        geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)) +
        stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = c(mean = daisymean, sd = daisysd), col = "tomato")
```

After initializing a blank plot with `geom_blank()`, the `ggplot2` package (within
the `tidyverse`) allows us to add additional layers. The first layer is a density 
histogram. `..density..` is a special term that tells `ggplot` to calculate the density for the specified variable (here `protein`) and use it to define the value on chosen axis. The second layer is a statistical function -- the density of the normal
curve, `dnorm`. We specify that we want the curve to have the same mean and 
standard deviation as the grams of protein in the daisies data. The argument `col` simply sets
the color for the line to be drawn. If we left it out, the line would be drawn in
black.


## Evaluating the normal distribution

Eyeballing the shape of the histogram is one way to determine if the data appear
to be nearly normally distributed, but it can be frustrating to decide just how 
close the histogram is to the curve. An alternative approach involves 
constructing a normal probability plot, also called a normal Q-Q plot for 
"quantile-quantile".

```{r qq, exercise = T}
ggplot(data = daisies, aes(sample = protein)) + 
  geom_qq() + geom_qq_line(alpha = 0.7, color = "red", linetype = "dashed")
```

This time, you can use the `geom_qq()` layer, while specifying that you will 
be creating a Q-Q plot with the `stat` argument. It's important to note that here,
instead of using `x` instead `aes()`, you need to use `sample`.

The x-axis values correspond to the quantiles of a theoretically normal curve 
with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 (i.e., the standard normal distribution).  The 
y-axis values correspond to the quantiles of the original unstandardized sample 
data. However, even if we were to standardize the sample data values, the Q-Q
plot would look identical. A data set that is nearly normal will result in a
probability plot where the points closely follow a diagonal line.  Any deviations
from normality leads to deviations of these points from that line.  `geom_qq_line()` provides a guide line to help you assess whether points deviate from a line.

The plot for daisies' grams of protein shows points that tend to follow the
line but with some errant points towards the upper tail.  You're left with the same
problem that we encountered with the histogram above: how close is close enough?

A useful way to address this question is to rephrase it as: what do probability 
plots look like for data that I *know* came from a normal distribution?  We can 
answer this by simulating data from a normal distribution using `rnorm`.

```{r sim-norm, exercise = T}
sim_norm <- data.frame(sim_val = rnorm(n = nrow(daisies), mean = daisymean, sd = daisysd))
```

The first argument indicates how many numbers you'd like to generate, which we 
specify to be the same number of taxa in the `daisies` data set using the 
`nrow()` function.  The last two arguments determine the mean and standard 
deviation of the normal distribution from which the simulated sample will be 
generated.  You can take a look at the shape of our simulated data set, `sim_norm`, 
as well as its normal probability plot.

2.  Make a normal probability plot (qq-plot) of `sim_norm`.  Do all of the points fall on 
    the line?  How does this plot compare to the probability plot for the real 
    data? (Since `sim_norm` is not a dataframe, it can be put directly into the 
    `sample` argument and the `data` argument can be dropped.)
    
```{r vuqymqrklhvinkjz-setup}
sim_norm <- data.frame(sim_val = rnorm(n = nrow(daisies), mean = daisymean, sd = daisysd))
```
    
```{r vuqymqrklhvinkjz, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = ___, aes(sample = ___)) + 
  geom_qq() + geom_qq_line(alpha = 0.7, color = "red", linetype = "dashed")
```


```{r vuqymqrklhvinkjz-solution}
ggplot(data = sim_norm, aes(sample = sim_val)) + 
  geom_qq() + geom_qq_line(alpha = 0.7, color = "red", linetype = "dashed")
```

```{r vuqymqrklhvinkjz-check}
# check code
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

Even better than comparing the original plot to a single plot generated from a 
normal distribution is to compare it to many more plots using the following 
function. It shows the Q-Q plot corresponding to the original data in the top
left corner, and the Q-Q plots of 8 different simulated normal data.

```{r qqnormsim, exercise = T}
qqnormsim(sample = protein, data = daisies)
```

Using the same technique, determine whether or not the calories from mints' pollen appear to come from a normal distribution.

```{r gbmknvwczbalsxme, exercise = TRUE}
qqnormsim(sample = ___, data = ___)
```

```{r gbmknvwczbalsxme-solution}
qqnormsim(sample = protein, data = mints)
```

```{r gbmknvwczbalsxme-check}
# check code
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```


## Normal probabilities

Okay, so now you have a slew of tools to judge whether or not a variable is 
normally distributed.  Why should you care?

It turns out that statisticians know a lot about the normal distribution.  Once 
you decide that a random variable is approximately normal, you can answer all 
sorts of questions about that variable related to probability.  Take, for 
example, the question of, "What is the probability that pollen sample from a randomly chosen daisy taxon has more than 60 grams of protein?"

If we assume that the grams of protein from daisies' taxa are normally 
distributed (a very close approximation is also okay), we can find this probability
by calculating a Z score and consulting a Z table (also called a normal probability
table).  In R, this is done in one step with the function `pnorm()`.

```{r pnorm, exercise = T}
1 - pnorm(q = 60, mean = daisymean, sd = daisysd)
```

Note that the function `pnorm()` gives the area under the normal curve below a 
given value, `q`, with a given mean and standard deviation.  Since we're 
interested in the probability that a daisy has more than 60 calories
from protein, we have to take one minus that probability.

Assuming a normal distribution has allowed us to calculate a theoretical 
probability.  If we want to calculate the probability empirically, we simply 
need to determine how many observations fall above 60 then divide this number 
by the total sample size. This is what we did when we were computing p-values ourselves.

```{r probability, exercise = T}
daisies %>% 
  filter(protein > 60) %>%
  summarise(percent = n() / nrow(daisies))
```

Although the probabilities are not exactly the same, they are reasonably close. 
The closer that your distribution is to being normal, the more accurate the 
theoretical probabilities will be.

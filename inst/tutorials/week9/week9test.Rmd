```

## Getting Started

In this pre-lab, you'll explore **ANOVA** (Analysis of Variance), a method used to compare the means of **more than two groups**. If you're asking:

> Does *any* group differ in its mean compared to the others?

...then ANOVA is your tool!


### Load packages

We’ll be using the **tidyverse** and **infer** packages to explore and analyze our data.

```{r load-packages, exercise = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
```


### The data

We’ll use the classic `PlantGrowth` dataset. It contains the dry weight of plants grown under three different conditions:

- `ctrl`: control group
- `trt1`: treatment 1
- `trt2`: treatment 2

Take a look:

```{r view-data, exercise = TRUE}
head(plant_growth)
```


### How many plants per group?
Use `count()` to find out:

```{r count-groups, exercise = TRUE}
plant_growth %>%
  count(group)
```


## Visualizing group differences

Let’s make a boxplot to compare the plant weights across the three groups.

```{r boxplot, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(plant_growth, aes(x = group, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

What does this plot suggest about the group means?

```{r plot-question}
question("Which group *appears* to have the highest median weight?",
  answer("ctrl"),
  answer("trt1"),
  answer("trt2", correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


## Summary statistics

Let’s compute the **mean and standard deviation** for each group.

```{r group-stats, exercise = TRUE}
plant_growth %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_weight = mean(weight),
    sd_weight = sd(weight)
  )
```

## One-Way ANOVA using R

We’ll use the `aov()` function to carry out an ANOVA. This will produce an ANOVA table with:
- degrees of freedom
- sum of squares
- mean square
- F value
- p-value

```{r base-anova, exercise = TRUE}
aov_result <- aov(weight ~ group, data = plant_growth)
summary(aov_result)
```

::: {.info-box}
The F statistic is calculated as the ratio of the mean square for the groups (between-group variability) to the mean square for the residuals (within-group variability). A larger F indicates greater separation between groups.
:::

### Fill in the blanks: Run your own ANOVA

```{r fill-anova, exercise = TRUE}
aov_result <- aov(___ ~ ___, data = plant_growth)
summary(___)
```

```{r fill-anova-solution}
aov_result <- aov(weight ~ group, data = plant_growth)
summary(aov_result)
```

```{r fill-anova-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```


## Interpreting the output

Which values in the ANOVA output correspond to:
- Degrees of freedom for groups and residuals?
- Mean square for groups and error?
- The F value?
- The p-value?

*Write a few notes here in your own words to help you understand how the table works.*


## Estimate R-squared

R² is the proportion of variation explained by the grouping variable:

```{r rsquared, exercise = TRUE}
r_squared <- 1 - (sum(aov_result$residuals^2) / sum((plant_growth$weight - mean(plant_growth$weight))^2))
r_squared
```


## Submit checkpoint

```{r context="server"}
learnrhash::encoder_logic(strip_output = TRUE)
```

```{r encode, echo=FALSE}
learnrhash::encoder_ui(
  ui_before = div(strong("Submit your hash in the form below."), br(), br()),
  ui_after  = learnrhash::iframe_ui(
    src = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0FKvlOHfchtSxwIpD9Jo65sDlTjeokodsO1vP64rLcVYZ2A/viewform?usp=header",
    width = "900px", height = "1000px"
  )
)
```

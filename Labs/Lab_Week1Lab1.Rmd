# R Basics, Including Visualization

# Introduction to RStudio and R Environment

# Explore the RStudio layout, including the script editor, console, and environment/history panes.
# Use the toolbar and menus for common functions.

# Basic Data Types, Objects, and Data Structures in R

# Example: Basic Data Types and Objects
numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
character_vector <- c("apple", "orange", "banana")
matrix_example <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

cat("Numeric Vector:", numeric_vector, "\n")
cat("Character Vector:", character_vector, "\n")
cat("Matrix:\n", matrix_example, "\n")

# Perform basic arithmetic operations and assign values to variables.

# Example: Basic Arithmetic Operations
result_sum <- sum(numeric_vector)
result_product <- prod(numeric_vector)
result_division <- numeric_vector[1] / numeric_vector[2]

cat("Sum:", result_sum, "\n")
cat("Product:", result_product, "\n")
cat("Division:", result_division, "\n")

# Visualization Using Base R Graphics and ggplot2

# Example: Visualization with Base R Graphics
plot(numeric_vector, main = "Scatter Plot of Numeric Vector")

# Example: Visualization with ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data.frame(x = numeric_vector), aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Numeric Vector", x = "Value", y = "Frequency")

# Create and manipulate vectors, matrices, and data frames.
# Visualize data using both base R graphics and ggplot2.

# Closing Remarks

# Experiment with R commands and explore additional functionalities in RStudio.
# This script serves as a starting point for practicing the concepts covered in the lesson.
